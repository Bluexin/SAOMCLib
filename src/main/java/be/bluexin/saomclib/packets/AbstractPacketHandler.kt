/**
 * Abstract class for handling packets.
 * Packets are means of communication between the server and the client, and should implement [IMessage].
 *
 * If your packet doesn't go both ways (server -> client AND client -> server), it is recommended to extend :
 *  - [AbstractClientPacketHandler] for server -> client only
 *  - [AbstractServerPacketHandler] for client -> server only
 *
 * One important consideration to take into account is that networking is threaded in Minecraft.
 * What that means is, when performing anything that has to do with the Minecraft world, you
 * should make a call to [IThreadListener.addScheduledTask] (using the mainThread argument in the handling methods).
